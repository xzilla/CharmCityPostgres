# Charm City Postgres Meetup Sponsorship Opportunities

Charm City Postgres is a new meetup group that includes local technologists and meets on a regular basis.  Our meetings typically draw people who are interested in sharing and learning about the people, processes, and tools required to build and operate PostgreSQL oriented solutions. 

Sponsoring our meetings is a great way to get involved with the local technology community.

We have a number of different sponsorship levels and unique sponsorship opportunities available.

Which of these sponsorship options best suits your needs? Please let us know so that we can make arrangements for you to sponsor some of our upcoming events!

## Monthly Sponsors:

We need venue, food, and beverages. In return, each sponsor will:

  * be thanked by the MC
  * have 4 minutes to address the meeting attendees, along with one slide
  * be thanked on the MeetUp event page
  * be listed on the [Meetup Sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/Charm-City-Postgres/sponsors/) page for at least three months

### Food Sponsor

Sponsor food for our monthly meetup!  Food sponsorship is roughly *$100 for each event*.  We ask that the food sponsor provide pizza, or other food of their choice, and paper goods sufficient to feed the meeting attendees.  As a general rule, this usually means 4-6 pizzas though it may require more depending on the number of attendees.

## Beverage Sponsor

Sponsor beverages for our monthly meetup!  Beverage sponsorship is roughly *$100 for each event*.  We ask the beverage sponsor to provide soft drinks and optionally beer/cider in sufficient quantities for the meeting attendees.  As a general rule, one-and-a-half or two cases of beer and 6-8 2 liter bottles of soda is enough.  The group tends to prefer craft beer and local options over mass produced beers.  
  
## Venue Sponsor

Provide us a space for up to 25 participants, and be OK with food and drinks. If you need an attendee list for security, we'll send the RSVP the afternoon of the MeetUp

  
## Logistics

One food, one beverage, and one venue sponsorship is available each meeting.

Charm City Postgres does not share contact information of our attendees with our sponsors.  However, sponsors are more than welcome to ask meeting attendees to share their information.

Please contact the organizers to arrange your sponsorship of Charm City Postgres!
